# cargo-lichking [![travis-badge][]][travis] [![crate-badge][]][crate] [![license-badge][]][license] [![rust-version-badge][]][rust-version]

Automated **li**cense **ch**ec**king** for rust. `cargo lichking` is a [Cargo][]
subcommand that checks licensing information for dependencies.

**Liches are not lawyers**, the information output from this tool is provided as
a hint to where you may need to look for licensing issues but in no way
represents legal advice or guarantees correctness. The tool relies at a minimum
on package metadata containing correct licensing information, this is not
guaranteed so for real license checking it's necessary to verify all
dependencies manually.

## Rust Version Policy

This crate only supports the current stable version of Rust, patch releases may
use new features at any time.

## Installation

To install simply run `cargo install cargo-lichking`.

## Usage

To get a list of all your (transitive) dependencies licenses run `cargo lichking
list`. To check license compatibility based off this [License Slide][] by David
A. Wheeler run `cargo lichking check`.

## Developing

When running via `cargo run` you'll need to provide an initial `lichking`
argument to simulate running as a cargo subcommand, e.g. `cargo run -- lichking
check`.

TODOs
- clean up output and logging
- Include package location and version in enum, probably hold &Package and &License instead and impl custom formats
- Figure out what confidense means
- add AND/WITH/OR vocab 
- Write nicer report with better options for when to exit 1 (probably only exit 1 when undefined license, which should be impossible)
- Add option to try to add template for missing files
- Move all matching to regex?
